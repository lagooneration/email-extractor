# Email Scraper for Organizations

## Why This Works Well

✔ **Handles Homepage and Contact Page:**  
If the email isn’t found on the homepage, the script automatically searches for a "Contact Us" page and extracts the email from there.  

✔ **Uses Regex for Accuracy:**  
The script extracts only valid email addresses using regular expressions, filtering out irrelevant text.  

✔ **Stores Output in Excel:**  
All extracted email addresses are saved in an Excel file, keeping the data structured and easy to use.  

✔ **Error Handling & Timeout:**  
Websites that don’t load quickly or return errors are skipped, ensuring smooth execution without getting stuck.
